# Help children in poverty in China

```
In rural China, 30 million of the families still live on less than US $1/day. Children walk several hours through rugged terrain to go to school every day. They enter dilapidated classrooms, where four students share a desk, and six share one outdated textbook. With substandard learning conditions, these children lag behind others of their age.

## Background

In summer 2011, when I was an undergraduate student at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), I joined a summer social practice program.

In this program, we went to [Xian County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_County) in Hebei province of China, to train the local teachers, and help the local students. These students were very passionate about learning, even though many of their families were struggling in poverty. Most of these children believe that education will change their lives, while some of them lost hope when their families can no longer support them in school.

And I fully understand that, these students in Xian County are already lucky, compared to those in rural areas, who have to walk hours through rugged terrain to go to school every day.

**Since you have found this page, I would like to invite you to help these children in poverty together with me. You can become a volunteer, buy life necessities for them, or just make a donation.**
